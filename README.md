# Melanoma Tumor Size Prediction

Melanoma is skin cancer which evolves from melanocytes, pigment-producing cells. Its primary cause is ultraviolet light exposure in individuals with low level of melanin. It is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. In 2012, the new occurrences were discovered in 232,000 people around the world. In 2015, there were 3.1 million people with active disease, resulting in 59,800 deaths. Melanomas appear in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, thus it is a daunting task to provide an accurate diagnosis or prognosis. Tumor size is one of the early signs which could determine the malignancy of tumors. This project aims to predict melanoma tumor sizes based on relevant attributes.

## Data Wrangling
[Data Wrangling Report](https://github.com/Michael-J-Son/Melanoma_Capstone/blob/main/data_wrangling/Melanoma_Data_Wrangling.ipynb)

### Distribution of Feature Values

![](./readme/feature_distribution.png)

  * Most correlations between features likely due to the inherent proportionality between mass and volume.
  * Majority of data points correspond to small tumor sizes.

![](./readme/malign_ratio_damage_ratio.png)

  * Mean of **malign_ratio** â‰ˆ 0.3, indicating high prevalence of malignancy in the dataset.
  * Left-skewed distribution of **damage_ratio** supports this notion.
